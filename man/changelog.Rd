}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{data.frame}. A \code{data.frame} to compare against
\code{y}. Treated as the original version of the data records.}

\item{y}{\code{data.frame}. A \code{data.frame} to compare against
\code{x}. Treated as the replacement version of the data records.}

\item{by}{\code{character}. How should \code{x} and \code{y} be compared?
Options include by "column" (the default) or "row".}

\item{report}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, a markdown report
("CHANGELOG.md") will be generated in the current working directory
(default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{author}{\code{character}. The author of to report in the changelog
report, if requested.}

\item{date}{\code{character}. The data to report in the changelog report,
if requested. By default, the current date is used.}

\description{
A function to evaluate and log changes in data records between two
dataframes and optionally create a markdown changelog.
}
\details{
This function assumes that input \code{data.frames} maintain the
same structure and aims to evaluate whether existing record values have
been changed (e.g. through data cleaning).
}
\examples{
# Dataset
x <- mtcars
# Shuffled dataset
y <- x[sample(nrow(x)), ]
# Evaluate differences
changelog(x = x, y = y)
# Create markdown report
changelog(x = x, y = y, report = TRUE, author = "Bob", ver = "0.0.1")
}
